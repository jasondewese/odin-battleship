# odin-battleship
A battleship app. This project is part of The Odin Project Curriculum to practice using TDD principles with jest, as well as more practice with OOP and modular program design. 


# Things I learned
- TDD principles and practices
- How to use Jest to create and run unit and integration tests for functions
- How to configure webpack with babel to work with Jest
- To test for thrown exceptions from a function with arguments you must wrap that function inside an anonymous function within the expect statement, so it references a function which returns the error.
